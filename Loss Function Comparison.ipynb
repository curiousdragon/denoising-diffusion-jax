    "While the mean loss and the noise loss functions should in theory optimize to the same parameters in the diffusion network, in practice, it's important to consider the advantages and drawbacks of these functions like computational cost, accuracy, etc. In this problem, we explore the computational costs of the mean loss and the noise loss.
